"The best revenge is
 massive success"
"Motivation will almost always
 beat mere talent"
"In the middle of difficulty
 lies opportunity"
"If you don’t walk today, you’ll
 have to run tomorrow"
"When today is over, it will
 never come back"
"Action is the foundational key
 to all success"
"Don’t let yesterday take up
 too much of today"
"Keep your face to the sunshine
 and you cannot see a shadow"
